            <h2>Cascade algorithm</h2>
            <ol>

                <li something="abc">Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear</li>
                <li>Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match</li>
                <li>Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS</li>
                <li>Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type</li>
            </ol>
        
        Lets look into all these one by one</p>

        <span style="border: 2px solid; font-weight: 900;">Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector</span>

        <h2>Specificity calculations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Universal Selector: 0</li>
            <li>Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1</li>
            <li>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10</li>
            <li>ID selectors: 100</li>
            <li>Inline styles: 1000</li>
            <li>!important attribute has 10,000</li>
