            Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries
            of South America except Chile.[19] They live in densely forested
            areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds,
            and marshes,[14] as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the
            tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their
            breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have
            flourished in cattle ranches.[7] They roam in home ranges averaging
            10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.[7] Many escapees
            from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around
            the world. Sightings are fairly common in Florida, although a
            breeding population has not yet been confirmed.[20] In 2011, one
            specimen was spotted on the Central Coast of California.[21] These
            escaped populations occur in areas where prehistoric capybaras
            inhabited; late Pleistocene capybaras inhabited Florida[22] and
            Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites in California and Hydrochoerus
            gaylordi in Grenada, and feral capybaras in North America may
            actually fill the ecological niche of the Pleistocene species.[23]
            Diet and predation A capybara eating hay at Franklin Park Zoo,
            Boston, Massachusetts Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on
            grasses and aquatic plants,[14][24] as well as fruit and tree
            bark.[15] They are very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves
            of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat
            a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants
            are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have
            to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[26] Plants
            that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in
            the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.[25] The
            capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by
            grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.[27] Capybaras are
            autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they eat their own feces as a source
            of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass
            that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and
            vitamins from their food. They also regurgitate food to masticate
            again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] As is the case with
            other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to
            compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;[19] their
            cheek teeth also grow continuously.[27] Cattle tyrant on a capybara
            Like its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the
            capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and capybaras not supplemented
            with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum
            disease as a sign of scurvy.[30] They can have a lifespan of 8â€“10
            years,[31] but tend to live less than four years in the wild due to
            predation from big cats like the jaguars and pumas and non-mammalian
            predators like eagles and the caimans.[19] The capybara is also the
            preferred prey of the green anaconda.[32]

          <h2>Story about capybara and her maggie</h2>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, in the heart of a dense jungle, there lived a
            curious capybara named Maggie. Maggie was known far and wide for her
            adventurous spirit and friendly demeanor. She spent her days
            exploring the lush greenery, making friends with creatures big and
            small. One sunny morning, while on her usual trek through the
            jungle, Maggie stumbled upon a majestic waterfall hidden deep within
            the foliage. Mesmerized by its beauty, she couldn't resist the urge
            to get closer. As she approached, she noticed a graceful bird
            struggling to free itself from a tangle of vines at the water's
            edge. Without hesitation, Maggie sprang into action, using her sharp
            teeth to carefully gnaw through the vines and set the bird free.
            Grateful for her help, the bird introduced herself as Lila, a wise
            and elegant egret who had been caught in the vines while fishing.
            Impressed by Maggie's bravery and kindness, Lila invited her to join
            a gathering of animals from all corners of the jungle. The gathering
            was called by the wise old tortoise, Grandpa Torty, who sought to
            discuss important matters affecting the jungle's inhabitants.
            Excited for the opportunity to meet new friends and contribute to
            the well-being of the jungle, Maggie eagerly accepted Lila's
            invitation. Together, they journeyed through the jungle, meeting
            creatures of all shapes and sizes along the way. As they arrived at
            the gathering, Maggie and Lila were greeted warmly by Grandpa Torty
            and the other animals. Together, they discussed ways to protect the
            jungle from threats such as deforestation and pollution, and how
            they could work together to ensure a bright future for all who
            called the jungle home. From that day on, Maggie became known not
            only for her adventurous spirit but also for her dedication to
            helping others and preserving the beauty of the jungle. And as she
            continued to explore and make new friends, her bond with Lila and
            the other creatures of the jungle only grew stronger, making her
            adventures even more meaningful.
